## Architecture

The application follows the **MVVM pattern**:

- **Views** – XAML UI layer responsible for user interaction  
- **ViewModels** – Commands, state management, and presentation logic  
- **Models** – Database entities and business data  

Core components:

- **BaseViewModel** – Implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`  
- **RelayCommand** – Encapsulates `ICommand`  
- **Service Layer** – Handles data access, messaging, CSV, charts, and budgets  
- **Dependency Injection** – Configured in `App.xaml.cs`

---

## Technologies

- **.NET 8**  
- **Visual Studio 2022**  
- **WPF / XAML**  
- **EF Core + SQLite**  
- **LiveCharts** (for animated charts)  
- **MVVM Pattern**  
- **Dependency Injection**  
- **Localization / Themes**  

---

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- .NET 8 SDK

**Database Setup:**

- The application uses SQLite + EF Core.

## Usage

1. **Expenses**: Add new expenses using the form. Use **TwoWay binding** to update UI instantly.  
2. **Filters**: Toggle filters to refine visible expenses by category or date range.  
3. **Sorting**: Sort the table dynamically by clicking column headers or using menu commands.  
4. **Charts**: Switch between category-based column charts and trend line charts.  
5. **Budget**: Set a monthly limit and get visual notifications when exceeded.  
6. **CSV**: Import/export expense data. The application handles invalid formats gracefully.  
7. **Themes & Language**: Change theme or language via menu, requiring a restart for persistence.  

**Pro Tip:** Editing an expense changes the **Add** button to **Save**, and provides a **Cancel** option to discard changes.
